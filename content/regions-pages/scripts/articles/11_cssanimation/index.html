CSS3 animation propertyThe standard language for control the layout and graphic styles in this new version comes with a new powerful control over animations. Now in html5 we can include animations or transitions over properties and transformations with techniques like web keyframes and transitionsThere will be certain cases where you need to publish a web animation, sure you know Flash is an easy tool for create and deliver interactive content over the web. In the new mobile revolution, the content must be written in standard way. Tools like Flash are not the best choice for simple animations.With new plugins or third part tools, you can export a complex animation created in Flash, and publish in HTML5 with a canvas element container. But what can you do for a simple menu button? what about “my share” button or a simple logo moved around the header zone? the answer to that is CSS3 animation property.The CSS3 animation property - a different approach from css transitions - can make a great impact with just a few lines of code . The standard for animations being in W3C’s working Draft:- http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#RecsWD - http:// www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-workbut we can start using it safety, in modern web browsers and mobile devices.In this article we introduce you to the world of web animation with CSS3 and their new concepts about keyframes. We’ll see how can define keyframes and their potential with others new effects part of CSS3.Flash or After Effects animators, understand the concept for keyframes, but in web this concept it’s a little different. While in Flash you do a movement animation with symbols or transitions for a vector shape, in web the keyframes are points for a certain animation.Now the animations should have a name to refer in other places (in javascript or css), also we need define a block of @keyframes and inside of them different points of animations.The new elements we need for doing an animation in CSS3 are:// animation name// animation points// properties to change in each point // configuration and call for animationTo start with the animation let’s we write our block of @keyframes with a nameEach time we need to start an animation we can look for it’s name, defined in the first line. It’s important to notice we should name it without spaces.We move an element <div id=”box”></div> in vertical until 100px and come back. We can change the properties of style as we need in each block of the keyframes. In this example see how the property “top” is changed 3 times, from start the animation until the finish.@keyframes my_animation {0% {top: 0px;}  50% {    top: 100px;}  100% {    top: 0px;In the W3C’s working draft, we can use an alias for 0% & 100%@keyframes my_animation {  /** works like 0%*/  from {top: 0px; }  50% {    top: 100px;  }  /** works like 100%*/  to {top: 0px; }Since we have now the design of our animation, the only thing we lack is the start moment. We will see how can start the animation in CSS through the property animation.#box {  /** assign name */  animation-name: my_animation;  /** duration in seconds*/  animation-duration: 5s;Other properties than may be assigned would be:// timing function (ease | linear | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out ) // number for repeat// direction (normal | reverse | alternate | alternate-reverse)// delay (in seconds)#box {  animation-name: my_animation;  animation-duration: 5s;  animation-timing-function: ease-in;  animation-direction: normal;  animation-delay: 1s;We just need to set this and the animation would start. Also, we can assign a class or a pseudo class like :hover  animation-name: my_animation;  animation-duration: 5s;  animation-timing-function: ease-in;  animation-iteration-count: 2;  animation-direction: normal;  animation-delay: 1s;This specification are in working draft, that means is not standard yet. But we can use it through the specific vendors properties. This feature is currently implemented in render engines like Mozilla Gecko and Webkit.We can have access to them with the prefix for each platform and also add the standard property for future support. I recommend the shorthand annotation.#box{  /** animation: name duration timing_function delay loops direction */  -webkit-animation: my_animation 5s linear 2s 4 reverse;  -moz-animation: my_animation 5s linear 2s 4 reverse;  animation: my_animation 5s linear 2s 4 reverse;}/** the prefix for webkit */@-webkit-keyframes my_animation {  from {    top: 0px;}  50% {    top: 100px;}to {top: 0px;} }/** the prefix for mozilla */  from {top: 0px; }  50% {    top: 100px;}to {top: 0px;} }/** the standard way */@keyframes my_animation {  from {    top: 0px;}  50% {    top: 100px;}to {top: 0px;CSS3 animations will establish a new way for doing movements and simple sequences, at this moment the W3C is completely aware for our needs in the web development. With features like this we can improve the experience of our visits and make the content better.Nowadays the web browsers which implements this way to do animations are: Chrome, Safari and Firefox and in mobile scene the Android Chrome and Safari mobile. It’s very important to not put css animations in core functionality because the experience in our sites could be affected.If needed, I recommend Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/) for evaluate the browser support of this feature./** in javascript */if(Modernizr.cssanimations){  // have animations}else{  // do not, oh no...A simple example I made for, is in the magazine source code bundle, I recommend to view the source code and take a look how I take just one definition for keyframes and set in several elements in HTML setting different durations or delays for each one.This are the basics for CSS3 animation properties an their use. I recommend this post to go deeper about this topic.// Taking Advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 with Modernizr // W3C Working draft// Keyframes and transformsI also recommend to learn about animations API in Javascript to control the play, stop or pause the animation, so you can start an animation with a behavior after a call in AJAX or after an event for jQuery or another one.I hope you enjoy this post and your next projects include this powerful feature of CSS3 web keyframes with web standards.- move objects- goToAndPlay- call DisneyTodo list- rookie- intermediate- expertDifficulty- CSS- W3C- animationPlaygroundby Francisco GranadosDON’T WORRY, BE APPLI
