Data Visualization With Web Standardsandrew explains how to use html, css and javascript to deliver first class data viz components to your usersAlmost every enterprise application requires some form of data visualization.  Whether it is a business dashboard, sales chart, performance comparison, or hierarchy viewer, there is always data, and there always needs to be an easy way to consume that data.   Using web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) there are 5 general techniques for visualizing data – here is a brief overview:You can embed images using the html <img> that have server-rendered data visualizations. This is nothing new… They are very basic, but will certainly work.Not interactiveRequires online & round-trip to serverNo “WOW” factor – let’s face it, they are boringExample: Google Image ChartsYou can use the HTML5 <canvas> element to programmatically render content based upon data in-memory using JavaScript. The HTML5 Canvas provides you with an API for rendering graphical content via moveTo or lineTo instructions, or by setting individual pixel values manually.  Learn more about the HTML5 canvas from the MDN tutorials.Can be interactiveDynamic – client side rendering with JavaScriptHardware accelerated on some platformsCan work offlineWorks in newer browsers: http://caniuse.com/#search=canvas“One Million Points” Scatter Plot – Let the page load, then use the mouse to click and drag regions to “drill into”.   This is a live visualization that shows a scatter plot with a histogram for massive data sets by manipulating individual pixels. This sample is rendering 50.000 points !And the source code:<script>			var data = [ 1,2,4,6,7,4,2,3,6,7,8,9,3,2,7,4,1,2,1,1,2 ];														function draw() 			{				var canvas = document.getElementById( “myCanvas” );				var context = canvas.getContext( “2d” );								//draw background grid;				context.strokeStyle = “#DDDDDD”;				context.lineWidth = 1;								var xIncrement = canvas.width / data.length;				var yIncrement = canvas.height / 10;				var padding = 2;								context.strokeRect( 0,0, canvas.width, canvas.height );								for ( var yPosition = 0; yPosition < canvas.height; yPosition += yIncrement )				{					context.moveTo( 0, yPosition );					context.lineTo( canvas.width, yPosition );				}								context.stroke();								//now we can draw the data				context.strokeStyle = “#000000”;				context.lineWidth = 1;				context.fillStyle = “rgba(0,0,255,0.25)”;								for ( var i = 0; i < data.length; i++ )				{					var xPosition = (xIncrement * i) + padding;					var dataHeight = canvas.height * (data[i]/10);					var yPosition = canvas.height - (dataHeight-1);										context.fillRect( xPosition, yPosition, xIncrement-2*padding, dataHeight );					context.strokeRect( xPosition, yPosition, xIncrement-2*padding, dataHeight );				}			}								</script>Vector graphics can be used to create visual content in web experiences.Client or Server-side renderingCan be static or dynamicCan be scripted with JSCan be manipulated via HTML DOMWorks in newer browsers (but not on Android 2.x and earlier): http://caniuse.com/#search=SVGDemos:“US Census Browser” – multi-platform PhoneGap application showing enterprise-class data visualization using web standards techniques.D3.js data visualization frameworkRaphael.js data visualization frameworkHighCharts data visualization libararySencha Touch ChartsKendo UI DataVizVisualizations like simple bar or column charts can be created purely with HTML structures and creative use of CSS styles to control position, visual presentation, etc… You can use CSS positioning to control x/y placement, and percentage-based width/height to display relative values based upon a range of data.   For example, the following bar chart/table is created purely using HTML DIV containers with CSS styles.Running sample: http://tricedesigns.com/portfolio/dataviz/HTML%20DOM%20Chart.htmlWebGL is on the “bleeding edge” of interactive graphics & data visualization across the web. WebGL enables hardware-accelerated 3D graphics inside the browser experience. Technically, it is not a standard, and there is varied and/or incomplete support across different browsers (http://caniuse.com/#search=webgl).  There is also considerable debate whether it ever will be a standard; however there are some incredible samples out on the web worth mentioning:WebGL GlobeGlobal Temperature AnomaliesRealtime Color Histogram- draw lines- fill color- build mapTodo list- rookie- intermediate- expertDifficulty- SVG- WebGL- CanvasPlaygroundby Andrew TriceDON’T WORRY, BE APPLI
